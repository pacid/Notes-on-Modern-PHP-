Notes on Modern PHP 


Initially Personal Home Page Tool (a bunch of CGI scripts for Rasmus Lerdorf's website).

Andi Gutmans and Zeev Suraski joined Lerdorf and wanted to change the set of CGI tools into a programming language with basic OOP features. Named it PHP3 and published it at the end of 1998.

Writing a specification of PHP was announced by Sara Golemon in 2014. (http://bit.ly/php-langspec)

The official interpreter was introduced with pHP4, called Zend Engine and it's written in C by Lerdorf, Gutmans and Suraski.

Recently a new interpreter was created called HipHop Virtual Machine by Facebook. (HHVM)

Hack is a new programming language with:
- typed variables
- new data structures
- additional interfaces
- backward compatible

Namespaces in PHP since PHP 5.3.0
